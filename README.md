Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data -- course project

The run_analysis file takes raw data collected from accelerometers used on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and transforms it into tidy data. 

Raw data can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A full description of the dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The purpose of the script is to:
1 - merge training and testing data sets.
2 - Extract the measurements that relate to mean and standard deviation
3 - Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 - Create a tidy data set with the average of each variale for each activity and subject
